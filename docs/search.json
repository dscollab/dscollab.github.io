During the social, we offered a variety of ice cream treats, including classic Kirkland chocolate options and vegan alternatives. The event had a successful turnout, with students mingling, making new acquaintances, and nurturing a strong sense of the data science community through this enjoyable gathering.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Speaker Panel\n\n\nMonday, April 8, 2024 @ Arts Building 1349\n\n\nOn Monday, April 8th, at the UCSB Arts Building, we had the honor of hosting two esteemed professors in Statistics and Data Science, Dr. Katie Coburn and Dr. Rituparna Sen, for our Professor Panel event in collaboration with UCSB’s Delta Sigma Pi. Throughout the panel, both professors shared their experiences and perspectives on Statistics and Data Science and offered insights into the current industry landscape, as well as advice on pursuing an academic career or extended education in the field. A highlight of the event was the emphasis placed on pursuing an academic route within Statistics and Data Science. Dr. Coburn and Dr. Sen provided invaluable insights into the academic journey, discussing topics such as graduate studies, research opportunities, and the importance of mentorship in shaping one’s scholarly pursuits. Approximately 40 students were able to get questions answered and gain a deeper understanding and inspiration for their academic and professional endeavors in Statistics and Data Science.\n\n\n\n\n\nMOSAIKS Speaker Event\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2024\n\n \n\nOn Friday, January 19th, at UCSB’s North Hall, we had the pleasure of hosting speaker Carlo Broderick, who received a Master’s degree in environmental data science at UC Santa Barbara’s Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. He came to speak about MOSAIKS (Multi-task Observation using Satellite Imagery & Kitchen Sinks), a new approach to analyzing satellite imagery with machine learning, for our Data Science Collaborative members.\nThe event provided a valuable opportunity for our curious-minded members to delve into the intricacies of MOSAIKS and its transformative potential. Carlo elucidated how MOSAIKS transforms satellite images into tabular data (features). One of the most remarkable aspects highlighted was MOSAICS’ remarkable ability to generalize across diverse tasks using a unified set of features, ensuring accessibility and effectiveness across a broad spectrum of applications.\nThrough engaging with Carlo during the speaker event, our members gained a deeper understanding of MOSAICS’ underlying principles and its practical implications. Carlo’s expertise and passion for leveraging machine learning to address real-world challenges shone through, inspiring our members to explore the intersection of data science and environmental analysis further."

    "text": "Data Types\nMuch in the way different variables (in a statistical sense) can have different types (numerical vs. categorical), so to can quantities in R. For example, R treats the quantity 2 differently from the quantity \"hello\". We use the term data type to, loosely speaking, refer to the actual type of a particular quantity (e.g. numerical, character, etc.) The main data types in R are:\n\ndouble: refers to numerical (real-valued) quantities\ninteger: refers to integers\ncharacter: refers to character- or text-type data (and will always be enclosed in either single quotation marks or double quotation marks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn R, numbers are by default encoded with type double.\n\n\nTo check the type of a particular quantity, we can use the typeof() function. For example:\n\ntypeof(1.1)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\ntypeof(1)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nAgain, note that the type of 1 is actually double! If we really wanted to reference the integer 1, we can use an L:\n\ntypeof(1L)\n\n[1] \"integer\""

    "section": "Data Structures",
    "text": "Data Structures\nWe can combine quantities in R as well, to produce what are known as data structures. Some of more common data structures in R are:\n\nVectors\nData Frames\nMatrices\nArrays\nLists\n\nEach data structure has a situation in which it is ideal; for now, let’s discuss vectors and data frames.\n\nVectors\nVectors are the most fundamental data structure in R. A vector is, effectively, a one-dimensional list of values. In R, we use the following syntax to create a vector:\n\nc(&lt;element 1&gt;, &lt;element 2&gt;, ...)\n\nFor example,\n\nc(1L, 3.5, \"hello\")\n\n[1] \"1\"     \"3.5\"   \"hello\"\n\n\n(By the Way: note how, in the output, R has converted all elements to be of type character! We’ll revisit this later.)\n\n\nData Frames\nAnother very popular way of storing data in R is using what is known as a data frame. A data frame can be thought of as a collection of vectors, arranged in tabular format; indeed, when storing data in a data frame, we are necessarily implementing the data matrix representation of data (see Workshop 02 for a refresher on this).\nData frames can be created using the data.frame() function in R:\n\ndata.frame(\n  colname1 = c(val1, val2, ...),\n  colname2 = c(val1, val2, ...),\n  ...\n)\n\nFor example:\n\ndata.frame(\n  col1 = c(2, 4, 6),\n  col2 = c(1, 3, 5)\n)\n\n  col1 col2\n1    2    1\n2    4    3\n3    6    5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen displaying data frames, R always puts an initial column corresponding to row indices.\n\n\nNote that data frames are created column-wise. Additionally, the columns in a data frame must all be of the same length;\n\ndata.frame(\n  col1 = c(2, 4, 6),\n  col2 = c(1, 3, 5, 7)\n)\n\nError in data.frame(col1 = c(2, 4, 6), col2 = c(1, 3, 5, 7)): arguments imply differing number of rows: 3, 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe columns in a data frame can be comprised of different data types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\nMake a data frame in R based on the following table:\n\n\n\nname\nspecies\nage\n\n\n\n\nRover\nDog\n4\n\n\nSamson\nParrot\n1\n\n\nOlivia\nCat\n3\n\n\nHoppers\nRabbit\n2\n\n\n\nAssign your data frame to a variable called animals. That is, after completing this exercise, you should be able to run animals and obtain\n\nanimals\n\n     name species age\n1   Rover     Dog   4\n2  Samson  Parrot   1\n3  Olivia     Cat   3\n4 Hoppers  Rabbit   2"

    "text": "Slicing/Indexing\nWe may wish to extract or access only certain portions of a vector and/or data frame. This can be accomplished using slicing (aka indexing).\nGiven a vector x, the ith element of x can be extracted using the syntax x[i]. For example:\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 3, 5, 7)\nx[2]\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nGiven a data frame d, the (i, j)th element of d can be extracted using the syntax d[i, j]. For example:\n\nd &lt;- data.frame(\n  col1 = c(1, 3, 5, 7),\n  col2 = c(2, 4, 6, 8)\n)\n\nd[4, 2]\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nWe can also access columns in a data frame by using the $ operator. That is: given a data frame df with a column named col1, the synax df$col1 returns the col1 column of df. For example, given the d data frame defined above, we can access col2 by running\n\nd$col2\n\n[1] 2 4 6 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen returning columns of a data frame using slicing, R always returns a vector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\nReturning to the animals data frame created above: return Olivia’s age in two different ways:\n\nby indexing\nby first extracting the age column, and then extracting the appropriate element."
