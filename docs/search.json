    "text": "What Is Programming?\nComputers are an incredibly useful tool in a Data Scientist’s arsenal. They are, however, also incredibly complex and can be difficult to communicate with. As such, programming languages are used to help us communicate with computers and provide them with instructions on what we want them to do. There are several different programming languages: the two most often used in Data Science circles are R and Python, though other popular languages include Julia, MatLab, and C+.\nComputer programs can be written in a variety of different environments and editors; for example, Python can be written in Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code, and several others. R is most commonly run in RStudio, which can be downloaded for free (along with the programming language R). Please see the previous lab for further instructions on how to download R and RStudio."

    "text": "Programming Quick Start\nThere is a reason we use the word “language” to describe programming languages- that is because they function quite like a human language. This means, among other things, that they each have their own syntax (i.e. set of grammar rules).\nPrograms are made up of expressions, like 2 + 2. We evaluate expressions by running (or executing) them in a programming language. Expressions are like the sentences of programming- they contain complex pieces of information that are conveyed between the user and the computer.\nMuch like sentences in other languages, expressions must obey a rigid syntax. For example, when we want to perform addition in R we must use the + symbol; we can’t, for example, say 2 plus 2 and expect R to know what to do.\nSpeaking of addition, one of the easiest ways to start using R is to use it as a calculator! R, much like many other programming languages, obeys the standard order of operations when evaluating expressions:\n\nParentheses\nExponents\nMultiplication\nDivision\nAddition\nSubtraction\n\nHere is a list of mathematical operators and their corresponding R syntax:\n\n\n\nOperation\nR Operator\nExample\nResult\n\n\n\n\nAddition\n+\n2 + 2\n4\n\n\nSubtraction\n-\n2 - 2\n0\n\n\nMultiplication\n*\n2 * 2\n4\n\n\nDivision\n/\n2 / 2\n1\n\n\nExponentiation\n^\n2 ^ 2\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\nEvaluate \\(\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{2 + 3^{3/2}}{4}\\right)^{2}\\) using R."

    "section": "Variable Assignment",
    "text": "Variable Assignment\nLet’s talk a bit about variables. Just like in math, variables in a programming language function as a sort of placeholder for a particular piece of information (be it a function, value, etc.) The act of storing information in a variable is called assignment, and in R variable assignment is performed using the &lt;- symbol.\n\n&lt;variable name&gt; &lt;- &lt;what you want to associate with the variable&gt;\n\nFor example, after running\n\nx &lt;- 2\n\nthe quantity x will always be synonymous with the quantity 2, and running x + 2 will return a value of 4 (as 2 + 2 = 4).\nR affords a lot of flexibility when it comes to variable names- that is, we can pick almost anything we want to be a variable name! There are, however, some exceptions:\n\nVariable names cannot start with a number\nVariable names cannot include a space\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is a good programming practice to give your variables names that are descriptive, but not overly long.\n\n\nIf we want to view the value stored in a variable, we have two options: we could simply type the name of the variable, and run the cell:\n\nx\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nor we could pass the variable name into a call to the print() function (we’ll talk more about functions in a future workshop):\n\nprint(x)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nVariable names in R are case sensitive.\n\n\nFor example, if you run\n\nmy_variable &lt;- 25\n\nR will not know what to do with the variable My_variable!\n\nMy_variable\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'My_variable' not found\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe errors R outputs often contain useful information- be sure to read them!\n\n\nSometimes it will be necessary to update or re-assign a new value to an existing variable. For example, let’s examine the structure of the following code:\n\nx = 2\nx = x + 3\n\nWhat do you think running x will return? If you said 5, you’d be correct! The key point of this is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen performing variable assignment, R reads from right to left.\n\n\nSo, in code example above, R first executed x + 3 (which is equivalent to 2 + 3; i.e. 5), and then re-assigned x the value 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\n\nDefine a variable called num_sections, and assign it the value of 3.\nDefine another variable called section_capacity, and assign it the value of 25.\nUpdate the value of num_sections to be one higher than it originally was.\nCompute the product of num_sections and section_capacity."

Comments are pretty much exactly what they sound like- they are short words or phrases that do not get executed, but can help the reader understand the code better.\nIn R, comments are created using the hashtag (#). For example:\n\nx &lt;- 1      # define x\nx &lt;- x + 1  # increment x by 1\n\nAgain, the phrases define x and increment x by 1 are never executed by R; they exist solely to help the reader understand what each line of code is doing."

Some of more common data structures in R are:\n\nVectors\nData Frames\nMatrices\nArrays\nLists\n\nEach data structure has a situation in which it is ideal; for now, let’s discuss vectors and data frames.\n\nVectors\nVectors are the most fundamental data structure in R. A vector is, effectively, a one-dimensional list of values. In R, we use the following syntax to create a vector:\n\nc(&lt;element 1&gt;, &lt;element 2&gt;, ...)\n\nFor example,\n\nc(1L, 3.5, \"hello\")\n\n[1] \"1\"     \"3.5\"   \"hello\"\n\n\n(By the Way: note how, in the output, R has converted all elements to be of type character! We’ll revisit this later.)\n\n\nData Frames\nAnother very popular way of storing data in R is using what is known as a data frame. A data frame can be thought of as a collection of vectors, arranged in tabular format; indeed, when storing data in a data frame, we are necessarily implementing the data matrix representation of data (see Workshop 02 for a refresher on this).\nData frames can be created using the data.frame() function in R:\n\ndata.frame(\n  colname1 = c(val1, val2, ...),\n  colname2 = c(val1, val2, ...),\n  ...\n)\n\nFor example:\n\ndata.frame(\n  col1 = c(2, 4, 6),\n  col2 = c(1, 3, 5)\n)\n\n  col1 col2\n1    2    1\n2    4    3\n3    6    5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen displaying data frames, R always puts an initial column corresponding to row indices.\n\n\nNote that data frames are created column-wise. Additionally, the columns in a data frame must all be of the same length;\n\ndata.frame(\n  col1 = c(2, 4, 6),\n  col2 = c(1, 3, 5, 7)\n)\n\nError in data.frame(col1 = c(2, 4, 6), col2 = c(1, 3, 5, 7)): arguments imply differing number of rows: 3, 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe columns in a data frame can be comprised of different data types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\nMake a data frame in R based on the following table:\n\n\n\nname\nspecies\nage\n\n\n\n\nRover\nDog\n4\n\n\nSamson\nParrot\n1\n\n\nOlivia\nCat\n3\n\n\nHoppers\nRabbit\n2\n\n\n\nAssign your data frame to a variable called animals.

This event aimed to foster connections among students, providing a platform for them to socialize, meet potential project collaborators, and connect with mentors or mentees. During the social, we offered a variety of ice cream treats, including classic Kirkland chocolate options and vegan alternatives. The event had a successful turnout, with students mingling, making new acquaintances, and nurturing a strong sense of the data science community through this enjoyable gathering."
